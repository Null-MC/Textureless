# Textureless
A Minecraft Resource Pack that uses material values instead of textures. This content is intended for debugging shaders or using as a base for your own custom RP's, not regular gameplay.

- Preview of Textureless using [BSL shaders](https://bitslablab.com/bslshaders) with promo-outline enabled.

## Try It
You can use this resource pack as-is, in either Lab-1.1 or Lab-1.3 encoding, both with generated 16x textures for surface-normal curvature and noise. You can find them under _Assets_ in the [Releases](https://github.com/null511/MCRP-Textureless/releases) section.

## Editing

If you do not already have it, you will first want to download a copy of [PixelGraph](https://github.com/null511/PixelGraph/releases). Links to CLI and UI can be found under _Assets_. To avoid publishing repository resources, `~/src` is used as the root content directory.

## Caution
Does actually contain _some_ tetxures for alpha masking (so foliage isn't ruined).
